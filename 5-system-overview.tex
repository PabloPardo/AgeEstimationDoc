In this work tow methods combining state of the art techniques have been proposed. A full description is delineated in this Chapter.

\section{Biologically Inspired Method}
As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:BIF} Biologically Inspired Features (BIF) have been proven to work specially good in age estimation \cite{Riesenhuber99hierarchicalmodels}\cite{conf/cvpr/GuoMFH09}\cite{han:age}. In this work a method is proposed using BIF as age representation and a hierarchical framework with SVM and SVR as a learning method.
 
\subsection{Background}

Inspired by how the visual cortex works, Maximilian Riesenhuber and Tomaso Poggio proposed the BIF model
