\section{Future Work}

As a future work, the three main parts of this project -proposed database, proposed methods and challenge organization- can be further explored.

The proposed methods can be improve by using face frontalization in the preprocessing step or by using the landmark location to calculate the \gls{bif} in local areas, not in a holistic fashion. Other methods should also be explored.

The web-application could be improved by collecting further information about the database face images such as gender, ethnic, whether the individual is wearing make-up or no, etc. It should also be maintained in order to keep the users playing, uploading more images, guessing the already existent ones and engaging other users to play.

After the organized challenge, the methods proposed by the contestants should be further analysed.
